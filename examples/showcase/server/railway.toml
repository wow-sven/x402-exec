# Railway deployment configuration for x402-exec Showcase Server
# 
# IMPORTANT: In Railway Dashboard, set "Root Directory" to "/" (project root)
# This allows pnpm to properly resolve workspace dependencies
#
# NOTE: Railway will automatically handle Git submodule cloning during the clone step.
# The git directory is not available inside the Docker container, so git commands
# should not be used in buildCommand.
