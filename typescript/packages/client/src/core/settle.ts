/**
 * Settle signed authorization with facilitator
 *
 * This function acts as a convenience wrapper that:
 * 1. Constructs the PaymentPayload according to x402 protocol
 * 2. Constructs the PaymentRequirements with settlement extra
 * 3. Calls core's settle() method to POST to facilitator's /settle endpoint
 * 4. Parses and returns the settlement result
 *
 * @param facilitatorUrl - Facilitator URL
 * @param signed - Signed authorization from signAuthorization
 * @param timeout - Optional timeout in milliseconds (default: 30000)
 * @returns Settlement result with transaction hash
 *
 * @throws FacilitatorError if request fails or facilitator returns error
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { settle } from '@x402x/client';
 *
 * const result = await settle(
 *   'https://facilitator.x402x.dev',
 *   signed
 * );
 * console.log('TX Hash:', result.transaction);
 * ```
